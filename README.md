### 🚀 Starting My Web Development Journey!

Hello, world! 🌍

My name is Pranjal Singh, and I'm thrilled to announce that I'm embarking on my web development journey! As I dive into the exciting world of creating websites and web applications, I'll be sharing my progress, projects, and learnings here on GitHub.

I'll be starting with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gradually exploring more advanced topics like front-end frameworks, back-end development, and full-stack projects.

Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, and join me on this learning adventure. Let's code, create, and innovate together!

Stay tuned for updates!

Happy coding! 💻✨

Pranjal Singh
